# 🎮 Connect Four AI Game

A Python implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game built with **Pygame** and **NumPy**. Play against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to make intelligent decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Connect Four board game where a human player competes against an AI. The AI analyzes possible future moves using the Minimax algorithm and optimizes its search using Alpha-Beta Pruning.

The game provides a graphical interface using Pygame and follows the standard Connect Four rules.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive graphical interface using Pygame
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Intelligent AI using:
  - Minimax Algorithm
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Win detection
  - Horizontal
  - Vertical
  - Diagonal
- Board evaluation heuristic
- Center-column preference strategy
- Smooth gameplay with AI thinking delay

## 🧠 AI Algorithm

The computer opponent uses:

- **Minimax Search**
  - Explores possible future game states.
  - Maximizes the AI score while minimizing the player's score.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
  - Eliminates branches that cannot affect the final decision.
  - Improves performance by reducing unnecessary computations.

- **Heuristic Evaluation**
  - Rewards:
    - Four in a row
    - Three connected pieces
    - Two connected pieces
    - Center column control
  - Penalizes dangerous player positions.

## 🎮 How to Play

- You are **Player 1 (Red pieces)**.
- The AI plays as **Yellow pieces**.
- Click on a column to drop your piece.
- The first player to connect **4 pieces** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If the board fills without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

---

## 📊 Game Rules

- The board has **6 rows** and **7 columns**.
- Players take turns dropping one piece at a time.
- Pieces always occupy the lowest available space in a column.
- Four consecutive pieces wins the game.
